# Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Formula 1 Car Navigation

This repository contains the implementation of a **reinforcement learning (RL) framework** developed for autonomous **Formula 1 car navigation**. Leveraging **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** and **PyGame** for simulation, the project focuses on optimizing racing lines, decision-making, and vehicle control for autonomous racing.

The system employs a **genetic algorithm** to evolve neural networks over generations, enabling virtual cars to learn optimal strategies for lap completion. It simulates 100 cars across 20 generations, with each generation improving upon the last based on performance metrics such as lap time and obstacle avoidance.

## üß† Methodology

1. **Training Environment**: A virtual F1 track is created using PyGame, where cars navigate autonomously.
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Cars learn from their actions using **reward-based feedback**.
3. **NEAT Algorithm**: Neural networks evolve over multiple generations, with better-performing networks passed to the next generation.
4. **Performance Metrics**: Each generation is evaluated on lap times, racing line efficiency, and obstacle avoidance.
